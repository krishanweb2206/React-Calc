# react-app-simple-calculator
A simple Calculator Application using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook.  

This application uses [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and ES6 style and are
combined using [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) to get the build for production purpose. 

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is used to *transpile* all [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) code to vanilla JavaScript code. States and Props are used to pass data within components. To install all the dependecies `npm` is used.

For calculation of all the expressions [math.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs) is used.
